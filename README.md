# SRGE_acc
Study on induced acceleration on surface of a granular asteroid after collisions

## Granular Ellipsoid
Granular ellipsoid rendered on MATLAB. Open './granular_ellipsoid/granular_ellipsoid.m' and run the script to get the body.

Various parameters are:
 * Axes of ellipsoid - a, b, c
 * Centre of ellipsoid - xc, yc, zc
 * Size of grains can be changed by changing 'mean_size'
 * Number of grains - n_o_rp
 * Deviation from mean - spread
 
Only the upper half is covered by the surface to make the grains visible. Uncomment corresponding line to get 
lower half too.
